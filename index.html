                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                I am  a research engineer at Caltech with a deep passion for computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. My work bridges the gap between fundamental research and real-world applications, striving to advance the boundaries of intelligent systems and automation, combining theoretical insights with practical engineering solutions.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                I am driven by a curiosity to understand and model the complexities of the world around us. This motivation fuels my pursuit of innovative methods that not only address practical challenges but also contribute to the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence and robotics.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                My interests lie in designing efficient perception methods allowing robotic systems to better interact with their environment. I am currently exploring the use memory-based architectures and foundational methods.

                        <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/learning-introspective-control" >LINC</a> is a DARPA-funded program that aims to develop machine learning-based introspection technologies allowing robotic systems to respond to unplanned perturbations at test time. 
                        The current phase of the program targets  technologies to assist crane operators during ship-to-ship transfers of supplies. The project focuses on creating robust perception and control methods to handle external perturbations. These include challenges like wind and dynamic sea conditions that affect payload delivery. I develop visual perception pipelines integrating object tracking, semantic segmentation, and 3D modeling for robust pose estimation
                        of payloads and targets.

                        <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/robotic-autonomy-in-complex-environments-with-resiliency" >RACER</a> is a DARPA-funded program that aims to develop and demonstrate new technologies enabling Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to navigate on unstructured off-road terrain at human-level speeds. My work involved developing real-time semantic perception pipelines, addressing challenges of deploying machine learning models in diverse and data-scarce settings. I also contributed to improving the semantic segmentation performance by exploiting available unlabeled and simulation data.

                        <a href="https://www.epfl-xplore.ch">EPFL Xplore</a> is a student-led robotics association with the goal of designing and developing a Mars rover from scratch. The association was founded in 2020 and has since grown to over +100 members and competed in 4 editions of the <a href="https://roverchallenge.eu/">European Rover Challenge</a>. I was a communication software engineer for the 2021 edition and a computer vision engineer for the 2023 edition.
